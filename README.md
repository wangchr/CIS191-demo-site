CIS 191 Project 3
-----------------

1) The git hook copies the files from the deploy branch into the ~/www directory, echoes a message telling the user that the server is starting, and restarts the server.

2) The Python server publishes the ~/www directory online.

3) A bare repository is a repository that doesn't have a working directory, waiting to receive a push to get files.
